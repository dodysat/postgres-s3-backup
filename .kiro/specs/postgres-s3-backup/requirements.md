# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a containerized application that automatically backs up PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3 storage on a scheduled basis. The application will be configurable through environment variables and deployable using Docker Compose, providing a reliable and automated database backup solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to automatically backup my PostgreSQL database to S3 on a scheduled basis, so that I can ensure data protection and disaster recovery capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backup interval (cron format) is reached THEN the system SHALL initiate a PostgreSQL database backup
2. WHEN a backup is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a compressed dump of the PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN the database dump is created THEN the system SHALL upload it to the specified S3 bucket and path
4. WHEN the backup process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log the success with timestamp and file details
5. WHEN the backup process fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue with the next scheduled backup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the backup application through environment variables, so that I can easily deploy it in different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from environment variables
2. IF S3_URL is provided THEN the system SHALL use it as the S3 endpoint
3. IF S3_BUCKET is provided THEN the system SHALL use it as the target bucket name
4. IF S3_PATH is provided THEN the system SHALL use it as the prefix for backup files
5. WHEN S3_ACCESS_KEY and S3_SECRET_KEY are provided THEN the system SHALL use them for S3 authentication
6. WHEN POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING is provided THEN the system SHALL use it to connect to the database
7. WHEN BACKUP_INTERVAL is provided in cron format THEN the system SHALL schedule backups accordingly
8. IF any required environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL log an error and exit gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the backup application using Docker and Docker Compose, so that I can easily integrate it into my containerized infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN it SHALL contain all necessary dependencies for PostgreSQL backup and S3 operations
2. WHEN the application runs in a container THEN it SHALL operate independently without external dependencies
3. WHEN Docker Compose is used THEN it SHALL provide a complete deployment configuration with environment variable examples
4. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL validate all required environment variables before beginning operations
5. WHEN the container is stopped THEN it SHALL gracefully handle any ongoing backup operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want backup files to be properly named and organized in S3, so that I can easily identify and retrieve specific backups when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backup file is created THEN it SHALL be named with a timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS)
2. WHEN uploading to S3 THEN the system SHALL use the configured S3_PATH as a prefix for organization
3. WHEN multiple backups exist THEN they SHALL be stored in a chronological structure
4. WHEN a backup is compressed THEN it SHALL use gzip compression to minimize storage space
5. IF the backup file already exists in S3 THEN the system SHALL either overwrite or create a unique name to avoid conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to automatically manage backup retention, so that I can control storage costs while maintaining appropriate backup history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS environment variable is provided THEN the system SHALL delete backups older than the specified number of days
2. WHEN a backup operation completes THEN the system SHALL check for and remove expired backups from S3
3. WHEN calculating backup age THEN the system SHALL use the backup file's creation timestamp
4. IF BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS is not provided THEN the system SHALL keep all backups without deletion
5. WHEN deleting expired backups THEN the system SHALL log each deletion operation
6. IF backup deletion fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue with normal operations
7. WHEN listing S3 objects for cleanup THEN the system SHALL only consider files matching the backup naming pattern

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track backup operations and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log the configuration details (excluding sensitive credentials)
2. WHEN a backup operation begins THEN the system SHALL log the start time and database details
3. WHEN a backup operation completes THEN the system SHALL log the completion time, file size, and S3 location
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
5. WHEN the cron scheduler runs THEN the system SHALL log each scheduled execution attempt
6. IF connection to PostgreSQL fails THEN the system SHALL log connection errors with retry information
7. IF S3 upload fails THEN the system SHALL log upload errors and attempt retry logic
